# OceanEDU.

This was my midterm project for CIS 3334, programmed in primarily Java. The purpose of this application is to educate children 
or adults on different sea animals and how to say their names in English by practicing with a sliding view which was built to mimic flash cards. 

Required Features Implemented: Model-View-ViewModel architecture, Firebase Db Storage, and proper coding techniques.

Selected Features Implemented: New Image Layout Widget(5pts), Sliding Views(10pts), and Audio Files(5pts).
